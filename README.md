# Semi-Siamese-Training

- Introduction

This is an implementation of Semi-Siamese Training (SST) by Pytorch. SST is a novel training method to address challenges in Shallow Face Learning (each ID with limited samples), one can refer to our paper "Semi-Siamese Training for Shallow Face Learning" ([Paper]()) in European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2020.
